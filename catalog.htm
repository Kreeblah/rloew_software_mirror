NOTICE:  G-Mail as well as several other E-Mail Services have added Filters
         that make it very difficult to send Attachments containing Executable
         Files. I have created a proprietary format that their Filters do not
         recognize. I will be using this format to deliver files to Customers
         using these E-Mail Services. Future Updates sent to multiple
         Customers at one time will be sent in this format regardless of
         Service used.

         These files will have a .TXT Extension. To convert them, Download
         the REPACKER Program at the end of the "FREE SOFTWARE" Section of
         this Catalog. Extract the REPACKER.EXE program and run the
         following on each Package:

         REPACKER <NAME>.TXT <NAME>.ZIP

         You can then Unzip the Package(s) normally.

<a href="Programs/Patchm.htm">WINDOWS 95/98/SE/ME RAM LIMITATION PATCH</a><br><br>
<pre>

The Windows 95/98/SE/ME RAM Limitation Patch Program patches Windows 95, 98,
98SE or ME to support Computers with more than 512MB of RAM. Unmodified
Windows 95, 98, 98SE or ME can malfunction or crash when more than 512MB of
RAM is present.

This Patch is perfect for Windows 98 Users who Dual-Boot with Windows XP and
have 2GB of RAM or more.

<a href="Programs/Patchtb.htm">TERABYTE PLUS PACKAGE</a><br><br>
<pre>

The TeraByte Plus Package is a set of Tools and Patches that provide support
for Hard Drives with Larger Capacities and/or Larger Sector Sizes than was
possible previously with DOS and Windows 98 or 98SE.

Support is provided for Hard Drives, including USB Drives, up to 32768TiB.
Logical Sector Sizes are supported up to 32KB in DOS and 4KB in Windows.
Larger Logical Sector Sizes can be emulated on Drives with smaller Sectors.
Support is added for Clusters up to 256 Sectors in length, allowing for
 extra large FAT12 and FAT16 Partitions if needed.
Boot Support is added for all of these Configurations.
Native Mode SATA Support is provided to allow SATA Drives to be connected
 directly to the Motherboard without using RAID Drivers.
Generic SATA Drivers are provided to support many SATA Controller Cards
 including the JMicron PCI-E Cards.
The RFDISK Partitioning Utility and the RFORMAT Formatting Utility are
 included (see below).
An Overlay is included that provides BIOS support for Hard Drives that are
 not supported by the Motherboard's own BIOS



</pre>
<a href="Programs/Patchenc.htm">ENCRYPTED DISK PATCH</a><br><br>
<pre>

The Encrypted Disk Patch Software patches the BIOS and Windows 98/98SE/ME to
provide full Disk Encryption. All files on the Hard Drive(s) are Encrypted
as they are written and Decrypted as they are read so no unencrypted data is
ever placed on the Hard Drive(s). If all of the Hard Drive(s) are Encrypted,
all Temporary Files, Cache Files, History Files, Swap Files, Slack Space,
etc. are Encrypted as well as all Application Files leaving no opportunity
for anyone to recover sensitive data. Laptops with all Hard Drives Encrypted
would no longer be a security threat, as no data or programs could be
recovered from it, if stolen.



</pre>
<a href="Programs/Patch137.htm">HIGH CAPACITY DISK PATCH</a><br><br>
<pre>

The High Capacity Disk Patch Program patches Windows 95/98/98SE/ME to provide
direct support for hard drives larger than 137GB without requiring a
controller card or the Intel Application Accelerator which can only be
used with some Intel chipset motherboards. The patch installs support for
the 48-Bit LBA addressing mode required for hard drives larger than 137GB.

NOTE: Some Programs and Documentation report this limit as 128GB (GiB).



</pre>
<a href="Programs/Bootman.htm">HIGH CAPACITY DISK BOOT MANAGER</a><br><br>
<pre>

The High Capacity Disk Boot Manager Program is designed to provide basic
support for hard drives larger than 137GB in the DOS environment or until
Windows can load and start using it's own drivers. It is intended for
Computers that only have BIOS support up to 137GB or have faulty support.
Windows 95, 98, 98 SE and ME users will still need the High Capacity Disk
Patch Program, or equivalent, to provide large hard drive support after
Windows takes over. Windows XP will require SP1 or later to support large
hard drives.

Some BIOSes have partial or defective support for large hard drives, In
particular, some models of EPIA Motherboards, with large hard drive support,
have a bug in their BIOSes that cause them to treat Drives other than the
Primary Master as though they are not large hard drives.

WARNING: Using a larger than 137GB hard drive in a computer with a BIOS that
         does not support large hard drives or has faulty support can result
         in corruption. When using Windows, this risk is limited to early
         Boot and Real Mode operations so corruption may not occur often
         enough to be noticed until it is too late to recover from backups
         that have already been overwritten with damaged files. The DEMO
         Package contains a test program to detemine if you are vulnerable
         to this problem.

NOTE: Some Programs and Documentation report this limit as 128GB (GiB).

<a href="Programs/Vitrofix.htm">WIN32:VITRO Disinfect and File Recovery Program</a><br><br>
<pre>

The WIN32:Vitro Virus is a very aggressive Virus that will infect Executable
Files when they are accessed. It is capable of spreading through Network
Shares when files are accessed. Many Anti-Virus Programs will Quarantine or
Delete these infected files, often resulting in an unbootable system since
these files are often required System Files. In addition, even if the
Operating System can be restored, the Applications that were infected are no
longer useable and have to be restored. Executable Files and Programs that
were not backed up may be lost entirely.

The WIN32:VITRO Disinfect and File Recovery Program identifies the
WIN32:Vitro Virus in Executable Files. It then disables the Virus and
restores the File so it can be used normally. This eliminates the need to
Quarantine or Delete Required System Files or Applications. Quarantined Files
may be Restored and then Disinfected with VITROFIX.

<a href="Programs/Conference.htm">CONFERENCE CONSOLE</a><br><br>
<pre>

The Conference Console is a Voice Conferencing Program that can support
up to 8 simultaneous connections. The Program can be customized to support
more than 8 if desired. It is designed for use with high speed internet or
intranet connections that can support high quality audio. Dial-Up support is
provided with lower quality audio and connectivity. This program is designed
primarily for Peer-to-Peer use. No server is required, so you are not
dependent on a service that could disappear, charge a fee, subpoenaed for
information or be compromised. AES-256 Encryption is available to secure
Voice and Text communication from interception. The Conference Console can
also be setup as a server, providing a public or semi-public voice chat room.
