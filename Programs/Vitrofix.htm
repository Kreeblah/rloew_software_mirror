The WIN32:Vitro Virus is a very aggressive Virus that will infect Executable
Files when they are accessed. It is capable of spreading through Network
Shares when files are accessed. Many Anti-Virus Programs will Quarantine or
Delete these infected files, often resulting in an unbootable system since
these files are often required System Files. In addition, even if the
Operating System can be restored, the Applications that were infected are no
longer useable and have to be restored. Executable Files and Programs that
were not backed up may be lost entirely.

The WIN32:VITRO Disinfect and File Recovery Program identifies the
WIN32:Vitro Virus in Executable Files. It then disables the Virus and
restores the File so it can be used normally. This eliminates the need to
Quarantine or Delete Required System Files or Applications. Quarantined Files
may be Restored and then Disinfected with VITROFIX.

The Demo Version (VITROTST) will identify WIN32:Vitro Infected Files but will
not Disinfect or Restore them.



REQUIREMENTS

Windows XP, 98, 98SE or ME.



NOTICE

VITROFIX removes an active infection and recovers files damaged by
WIN32:Vitro. It does not scan archives or look for loaders that may reinfect
your system. You may need other Anti-Virus programs to prevent reinfection.
WIN32:Vitro often compromises the function of other Anti-Virus Programs, so
they may work better once the WIN32:Vitro infection is removed.
