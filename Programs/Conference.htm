The Conference Console is a Voice Conferencing Program that can support
up to 8 simultaneous connections. The Program can be customized to support
more than 8 if desired (see ORDERING below). It is designed for use with high
speed internet or intranet connections that can support high quality audio.
Dial-Up support is provided with lower quality audio and connectivity.
This program is designed primarily for Peer-to-Peer use. No server is
required, so you are not dependent on a service that could disappear, charge
a fee, subpoenaed for information or be a compromised. AES-256 Encryption is
available to secure Voice communication from interception. The Conference
Console can also be setup as a server, providing a public or semi-public
voice chat room.
