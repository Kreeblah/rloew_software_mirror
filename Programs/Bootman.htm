The High Capacity Disk Boot Manager Program is designed to provide basic
support for hard drives larger than 137GB in the DOS environment or until
Windows can load and start using it's own drivers. It is intended for
Computers that only have BIOS support up to 137GB or have faulty support.
Windows 95, 98, 98 SE and ME users will still need the High Capacity Disk
Patch Program, or equivalent, to provide large hard drive support after
Windows takes over. Windows XP will require SP1 or later to support large
hard drives.

Some BIOSes have partial or defective support for Large Hard Drives, In
particular, some models of EPIA Motherboards, with Large Hard Drive support,
have a bug in their BIOSES that cause them to treat Drives other than the
Primary Master as though they are not Large Hard Drives. For these Computers,
use the Alternate Version of BOOTMAN.
