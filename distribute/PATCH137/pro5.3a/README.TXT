The High Capacity Disk Patch Program patches Windows 98/98SE/ME to provide
direct support for Hard Drives larger than 137GB without requiring a
controller card or the Intel Application Accelerator which can only be
used with some Intel Chipset Motherboards. The Patch installs support for the
48-Bit LBA addressing mode required for Hard Drives larger than 137GB.



REQUIREMENTS

Windows 95 Release 2 (See Note Below)
Windows 98, 98SE or ME.
Motherboard IDE and/or SATA Controller recognized by the Default ESDI_506.PDR
 Port Driver. Customized SATA .INF files are required, contact author for
 further information

BIOS support for hard drives >137GB (48-Bit LBA) or
A Windows Compatible Boot Manager that supports Hard Drives >137GB.
A Mini Boot Manager is now available from Rudolph R. Loew

NOTE: Some documentation and utilities may report this limit as 128GB.

WARNING: Some BIOSes have defective support for 48-Bit LBA. Rearranging
         Drives may cause a previously working system to fail. Verify
         support using 48BITLBA.EXE for all Drive arrangements you plan to
         use. In particular, VIA EPIA BIOSes before 07/05 may claim to
         support 48-Bit LBA, and will show the full size of the Drive, but
         will not actually support the Drive if it is not the Primary Master.
         Users of VIA EPIA motherboards should contact the Author to obtain
         a Patched BIOS if needed.

NOTE: If you are using the original version of Windows 95, upgrade the
      existing Disk Driver with REMIDEUP.EXE available from Microsoft at:
      http://support.microsoft.com/kb/171353/EN-US/
      before Installing the Patch.
