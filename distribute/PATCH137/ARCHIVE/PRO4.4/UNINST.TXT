The following procedure can be used to minimize the risk of corruption:

1. Install the program but do not allow it to reboot Windows.
2. Right Click "My Computer".
3. Click on "Properties".
4. Ckick on "Device Manager".
5. Double Click on "Hard disk controllers".
6. Double Click on the Primary controller line (actual name variea).
7. Click on "Driver".
8. Click on "Driver File Details".
9. Look for a line ending with ESDI_506.PDR (or alternate (see step 42)).
10. If there is no such line the driver has been bypassed, go to step 12.

11. If the line is present the driver has not been bypassed, go to step 16.
12. If the program guarantees support of Large Hard Drives go to step 42.
13. If not, try to uninstall the program.
14. If successful go to step 17.
15. If not, you will have to restore an older Registry, go to step 27.
16. Go to the Windows SYSTEM\IOSUBSYS Folder.
17. Locate the ESDI_506.PDR file. If not visible, you will need to change the
    folder view to Show Hidden Files.
18. The date on the file should be the date you last installed the High
    Capacity Disk Patch.
19. If you are sure the date is the same, reboot Windows, you are done.
20. Rerun the High Capacity Disk Patch.
21. If it offers to uninstall the Patch, answer NO and go to step 23.
22. If it reinstalls the Patch go to Step 23, otherwise go to step 24.
23. Reboot Windows, you are done.
24. Delete the ESDI_506.PDR file. You may have to unprotect it first.
25. Rename the ESDI_506.BAK to ESDI_506.PDR.
26. Go to step 20.
27. WARNING THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURE ALTERS THE REGISTRY AND MAY MAKE YOUR
    SYSTEM UNBOOTABLE. TO MINIMIZE THIS RISK, FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS
    CAREFULLY.
28. Shutdown Windows and Boot from DOS (NOT WINDOWS).
29. Go to the Windows SYSBCKUP Directory.
30. This directory will contain a number of files named RB00x.CAB where x is
    usually a number from 0 to 5.
31. If there are no such files you will not be able to restore the Registry.
32. If any of these files are dated around or after you began installation of
    the program you are trying to remove, rename them by changing the suffix
    from .CAB to .XXX
33. Go to the Windows Directory.
34. Run the following command:  ATTRIB -S -H -R *.DAT
35. Rename the following files, if they are present, by changing their suffix
    from .DAT to .XXX

    SYSTEM.DAT, USER.DAT, CLASSES.DAT

36. Go to step 20. When you reach step 23 go to step 37.
37. Boot Windows. Follow the instructions to repair the Registry.
38. Reboot Windows.
39. Run 48BITLBA to test support. In Windows ME you cannot test support
    provided by other programs.
40. If the test passes you are done.
41. If not, you will have to reinstall Windows to avoid potential corruption.
42. Repeat steps 1-8.
43. Locate a line that contains a FileName in the Windows SYSTEM\IOSUBSYS
    folder.
44. Record the Name of the File. In the future use this FileName instead of
    ESDI_506.PDR in step 9.
