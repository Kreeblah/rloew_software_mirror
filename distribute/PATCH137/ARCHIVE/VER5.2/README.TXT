The High Capacity Disk Patch Program patches Windows 98/98SE/ME to provide
direct support for Hard Drives larger than 137GB without requiring a
controller card or the Intel Application Accelerator which can only be
used with some Intel Chipset Motherboards. The Patch installs support for the
48-Bit LBA addressing mode required for Hard Drives larger than 137GB.

The latest Version of this Software can be Downloaded from Simtel or
members.aol.com/rloew1.


REQUIREMENTS

Windows 95 Release 2 (See Note Below)
Windows 98, 98SE or ME.
Motherboard IDE Controller recognized by the Default ESDI_506.PDR Port Driver

BIOS support for hard drives >137GB (48-Bit LBA) or
A Windows Compatable Boot Manager that supports Hard Drives >137GB.
A Mini Boot Manager is now available from Rudolph R. Loew

NOTE: Some documentation and utilities may report this limit as 128GB.
      The Demo Limit for these utilities is 136GB.

WARNING: Some BIOSes have defective support for 48-Bit LBA. Rearranging
         Drives may cause a previously working system to fail. Verify
         support using 48BITLBA.EXE for all Drive arrangements you plan to
         use. In particular, VIA EPIA BIOSes before 07/05 may claim to
         support 48-Bit LBA, and will show the full size of the Drive, but
         will not actually support the Drive if it is not the Primary Master.
         Users of VIA EPIA motherboards should contact the Author to obtain
         a Patched BIOS if needed.

NOTE: Windows 95 performance has not been tested. Verify performance with
      this Demo Version before purchasing the Full Version. If you are using
      the original version, Upgrade the existing Disk Driver with
      REMIDEUP.EXE available from Microsoft at:
      http://support.microsoft.com/kb/171353/EN-US/
      before Installing the Demo Patch.
