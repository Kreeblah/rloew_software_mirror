The High Capacity Disk Patch Program patches Windows 98/98SE/ME to provide
direct support for Hard Drives larger than 137GB without requiring a
controller card or the Intel Application Accelerator which can only be
used with some Intel Chipset Motherboards. The Patch installs support for the
48-Bit LBA addressing mode required for Hard Drives larger than 137GB.



REQUIREMENTS

Windows 95 Release 2 (See Note Below)
Windows 98, 98SE or ME.
Motherboard IDE Controller recognized by the Default ESDI_506.PDR Port Driver

BIOS support for hard drives >137GB (48-Bit LBA) or
A Windows Compatable Boot Manager that supports Hard Drives >137GB.
A Mini Boot Manager is now available from Rudolph R. Loew

NOTE: Some documentation and utilities may report this limit as 128GB.

CAUTION: Some BIOSes have defective support for 48-Bit LBA. Rearranging
         Drives may cause a previously working system to fail. Verify
         support with all Drive arrangements you plan to use.

NOTE: Windows 95 performance has not been tested. Upgrade the existing
      Disk Driver with REMIDEUP.EXE available from Microsoft at
      http://support.microsoft.com/kb/171353/EN-US/
      before Installing the Patch.
