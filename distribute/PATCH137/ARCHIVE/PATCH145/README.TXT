The High Capacity Disk Patch Program patches Windows 98/98SE/ME to provide
direct support for hard drives larger than 137GB without requiring a
controller card or the Intel Application Accelerator which can only be
used with an Intel chipset motherboard. The patch installs support for the
48-Bit addressing mode required for hard drives larger than 137GB.

This Demo version is limited to 145GB. Do not use with any hard drive
containing a partition that is above or extends above 145GB.
