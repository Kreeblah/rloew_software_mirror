                        48BITLBA.EXE BUG FIX

The 48BITLBA.EXE Program included in the TBPLUS 1.0 Package does not
correctly restore the data on a larger than 2TiB Hard Drive after it performs
it's test. This can cause corruption so the Program should be replaced.

This Program is included in the BOOTMAN2 Package and the TBPLUS Floppy Image.

A fixed 48BITLBA.EXE and a replacement FLOPPY.IMG File containing the fixed
48BITLBA.EXE are contained within this Update.

Replace the 48BITLBA.EXE Program in the extracted BOOTMAN2 Package and any
copies you may have made.

Replace the FLOPPY.IMG File in the extracted TOOLS Package and any copies you
may have made.

If you have created a Floppy using the old FLOPPY.IMG, you can either
recreate it or replace the 48BITLBA.EXE within it.

If you have created a CD or DVD using the old FLOPPY.IMG, you will have to
reburn it.
