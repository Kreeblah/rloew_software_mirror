This Package contains enhanced FILE64 Files with basic Unicode support added.

the FILE64 Package.

Windows 98/98SE/ME Large File Emulator.

UNINSTALL

1. Boot to DOS.

USAGE

Refer to the Manual for the Windows 98/98SE/ME Version of FILE64.

Since only Unicode support for the File APIs has been added, few, if any,
Unicode programs will work with this Package. A more comprehensive solution,
such as my Unicows Wrappers, will usually be required.
