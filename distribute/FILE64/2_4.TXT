CopyFile and MoveFile go into Raw Mode if all File64 arguments are a direct

Nero creates Image Files up to 4GiB-1 which are larger than the extent size.
It will split files larger than 4GiB-1 even in File64 Folders.
Nero will recognize Images and ISO Files larger than 4GiB so split Image
Files can be merged into one.
