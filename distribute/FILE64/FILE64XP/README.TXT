This Package intercepts User Mode FileSystem API requests so that a set of
smaller Files will appear as a single large File. This allows Programs to
Create Files that are larger than 4GiB on FAT32 Partitions or on remote
shares hosted on Windows 98, 98SE or, ME. These Files can then be Read or
Modified by other Programs. Downloading and Playing or Archiving Blu-Ray
Videos are a example of what can be done with this Package.

This package is intended to be used with the Windows 98/98SE/ME Version of
the FILE64 Package.

USAGE

Refer to the Manual for the Windows 98/98SE/ME Version of FILE64 except as
follows when working with files larger than 4GiB-4096 Bytes:

FILE64 Enabled Folders can be created on NTFS or ExFat Partitions to support
remote access by or through 9x Systems.

These files can be copied between Enabled Folders on any Partition and
Un-Enabled Folders on NTFS or ExFat Partitions.

Remote access by or through a 9x System requires that the Files be placed in
an Enabled Folder regardless of Partition Type.

Any OS that accesses Files in an Enabled Folder must have FILE64 Installed.

MoveFileEx is not currently supported, so some Move Operations may not work
from File Explorer.

FILE64 is not required on the OSes that hold these Files or their
intermediaries if the Files are placed in an Enabled Folder. These OSes will
not be able to properly access the Files.



LIMITATIONS

Only basic Unicode is provided. Usage with non-English character File Names
may result in unexpected results.
