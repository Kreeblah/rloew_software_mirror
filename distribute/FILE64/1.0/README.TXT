This Package intercepts User Mode FileSystem API requests so that a set of
smaller Files will appear as a single large File. This allows Programs to
Create Files that are larger than 4GiB. These Files can then be Read or
Modified by other Programs. Downloading and Playing or Archiving Blu-Ray
Videos are a example of what can be done with this Package.
