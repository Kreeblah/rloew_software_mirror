The R. Loew SHELL32 Extender adds three missing functions to the Windows 98SE
SHELL32 that are often used by software written for later operating systems.

The added functions are:

SHGetFolderPathA
SHGetFolderPathW
SHGetFolderLocation

The first two are forwarded to SHFOLDER.DLL and the third is translated to
use the SHGetSpecialFolderLocation API Entry.

The package consists of the following files:

SHELL32.DLL     SHELL32 API Redirector with Icons and translation code.
SHELLXX.DLL     Modified original SHELL32.DLL for all other API Functions.
SHFOLDER.DLL    Unmodified Last Update to SHFOLDER.DLL.
SHFOLDXX.DLL    Modified Last Update to SHFOLDER.DLL for use by Redirector.
