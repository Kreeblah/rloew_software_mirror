The Windows 95/98/SE/ME RAM Limitation Patch Program patches Windows 95, 98,
98SE or ME to support Computers with more than 512MB of RAM. Unmodified
Windows 95, 98, 98SE or ME can malfunction or crash when more than 512MB of
RAM is present.

This Patch has an option to increase a memory resource that is required to
prevent the "VFAT Device Initialization Failed" Error or other Error that
occurs when the resource is depleted. This often happens with newer Ethernet
Drivers or if you have a very large Registry.


REQUIREMENTS

Windows 95, 98, 98SE or ME.

NOTE: Computers having more than 3GB of RAM frequently limit RAM
      available to 32-Bit Software to as little as 3GB. Any additional
      Memory is reserved for 64-Bit Software.


DEMO VERSION

The Demo Version of this Software will freeze approximately 10 Minutes after
Windows is booted. This provides time to verify proper operation of this
Patch with the intended amount of RAM, and to Uninstall the Patch. Shutdown
your Computer before the 10 Minutes have elapsed, or you will be forced to
Reset or Power Down your Computer without doing a proper shutdown.


LICENSE

Read the Licensing terms and conditions in the LICENSE.TXT file before
using the Patch Program. Installation of the Patch constitutes acceptance
of all of the terms and conditions in the LICENSE.TXT file.
