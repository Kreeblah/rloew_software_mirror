NOTE: Computers having more than 3GB of RAM frequently limit RAM
      available to 32-Bit Software to as little as 3GB. Any additional
      Memory is reserved for 64-Bit Software.

The Demo Version of this Software will freeze approximately 10 Minutes after
Windows is booted. This provides time to verify proper operation of this
Patch with the intended amount of RAM, and to Uninstall the Patch. Shutdown
your Computer before the 10 Minutes have elapsed or you will be forced to
Reset or Power Down your Computer without doing a proper shutdown.
