The Windows 98/SE/ME RAM Limitation Patch Program patches Windows 98, 98SE
or ME to support Computers with more than 512MB of RAM. Unmodified Windows
98, 98SE or ME can malfunction or crash when more than 512MB of RAM is
present.

This Patch extracts the Windows Memory Manager (VMM.VXD) and the Disk Cache
Manager (VCACHE.VXD) contained within the VMM32.VXD File in the Windows
SYSTEM Directory, if necessary, The Patch then Updates all three of them.

NOTE: Computers having more than 3GB of RAM frequently limit RAM
      available to 32-Bit Software, to as little as 3GB. Any additional
      Memory is reserved for 64-Bit Software.



DEMO VERSION

The Demo Version of this Software will freeze approximately 10 Minutes after
Windows is booted. This provides time to verify proper operation of this
Patch with the intended amount of RAM, and to Uninstall the Patch. Shutdown
your Computer before the 10 Minutes have elapsed or you will be forced to
Reset or Power Down your Computer without doing a proper shutdown.

FIRST 16MB OF RAM MEMORY REQUIREMENTS

Some Devices, especially many Gigabit Ethernet Controllers, require space in
the first 16MB of Physical RAM. Low Physical RAM is also used by Windows 98
or 98SE for Memory Tables. If there is not enough Free Low Physical Memory,
the most common symptoms are Windows crashing during Bootup. Rebooting, going
to a Blank Screen, or reporting a VFAT Error.

Having a very large Registry can cause this problem as well, and increasing
RAM reduces Low Physical RAM further, increasing the likelihood of this
problem appearing.


If Windows 98 or 98SE crashes do the following to increase Low Physical Memory.

1. Run PATCHMEM to Uninstall the Patch.
2. Run the following to ReInstall the Patch:

   PATCHMEM /M
 
3. Reboot.



OTHER PROGRAMS, PATCHES, DRIVERS AND UPDATES

Reinstalling, Repairing or Upgrading Windows, or Adding/Removing Windows
Components may overwrite the Patched files. If an Updated VMM.VXD and/or
VCACHE.VXD file is added to the Windows SYSTEM\VMM32 Directory, the Patched
VMM.VXD and/or VCACHE.VXD Module will be overwritten.

Reinstalling the Patch will be needed to RePatch these files.

Unfortunately there is no way to determine what effect other programs will
have until they are installed.

If Windows cannot be rebooted after an Installation, reduce the amount of
RAM to 512MB or less or select the "Command prompt only" option in the
Windows Startup menu.

Go to the Directory where the PATCHM Program is located. Run the PATCHM
Program to Reinstall the Patch. If the PATCHM Program asks to Uninstall the
Patch, say Yes to Uninstall, then Rerun the PATCHM Program to Reinstall the
Patch. If you are unable to Reinstall the Patch, go to the Windows
SYSTEM\VMM32 Directory. Copy the following files to another folder and then
delete the originals:

VMM.VXD
VMM.BAK
VCACHE.VXD
VCAHCE.BAK



PROGRAM COMPATABILITY

Some Programs, especially Programs that manage RAM Memory, may not operate or
not operate properly with large amounts of RAM. If specific Programs are
vital to operation of your system, it is recommended that they be tested with
the Demo Version before purchase. If a Program stops working when RAM is
added, please contact Author. Known problems are listed below.


The following issue has been identified:

EMM386.EXE will lockup all memory if more than approximately 2800MB of RAM is
present. If you are using EMM386.EXE with more than 2800MB of RAM, add the
following line to your CONFIG.SYS file BEFORE the EMM386.EXE line:

DEVICE=<path>\HIMEM.SYS /NUMHANDLES=64

<path> is the path to your HIMEM.SYS file, usually C:\WINDOWS
If you already have a line installing HIMEM.SYS, add the NUMHANDLES option.
if you are already using the NUMHANDLES setting, make sure it is at least 64.


The following Drivers need to be updated to the latest Version:

3Com 905C (Update to 5.4)
Related Drivers may need to be updated


The following Program will fail with large amounts of RAM:

FASTDEFRAG 2.3  (fails at approximately 1280MB)



WARNING

THE POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR DATA LOSS TO OCCUR DUE TO ERRORS IN THE PATCH OR
IF THE PATCHED PROGRAMS ARE BYPASSED OR OVERWRITTEN. DO NOT USE IN CRITICAL
SYSTEMS OR WHERE HUMAN SAFETY IS INVOLVED.

Please E-Mail any Bug Reports to RLoew@hotmail.com.



PROGRAM OPERATION

The VMM.VXD and VCACHE.VXD Files are extracted from the VMM32.VXD file if
they do not already exist.

The three Files are renamed to provide Backup Files before the Patched Files
are written. The Backup Files have the same name as the Original Files but
the extension is changed to .BAK provided the File's Name has an extension.
If not, a .BAK extension is added.

If an earlier Version of the Patch is found, or a Demo Version, it is
Uninstalled.

NOTE: Patch Versions 4.0, or earlier, cannot be Uninstalled by this Patch.
      You must Uninstall it first using the original Patch Program.

The Patched Files are deleted and the Backup Files are renamed back if the
Patch is Uninstalled. If the Backup Files are not present, the Patch cannot
be Uninstalled.



OPTIONS

The Program automatically examines the Computer to locate the necessary Files.

The Program can be redirected to Patch specific Files by specifying
File Names as follows:

PATCHM [Options] [VMM32File VMMFile VCACHEFile]

VMM32File is the name of the VMM32.VXD file to extract from and to be updated.
VMMFile is the name of the VMM.VXD file to be updated.
VCACHEFile is the name of the VCACHE.VXD file to be updated.

Entering "-" for a Filename will prevent the file from being accessed or
updated.
Entering "*" for a Filename will revert to the Default System File.

If you specify any Filenames, you must specify all three. Use "*" as
placeholders for Filenames you are not specifying, and "-" for files you do
not wish to access or modify.

You must enable the VMM32File update if the VMMFile and/or VCACHEFile need to
be extracted.

Only use DOS 8.3 Format Filenames.

If the default Filenames for all three files to be Patched are used, use the
following syntax:

PATCHM [Options]

Options:  /A    Move AGP and Unfixed Tables >=128MB to Shared Arena
          /C:#  Set Absolute Max File Cache (MB)
          /I    Install Only
          /M    Move VXD Data above 16MB
          /P    Install PROTHOOK

The Move AGP Option (/A) will force AGP amd Unfixed Memory Allocation
Requests for the SYSTEM Arena to the SHARED Arena. This will reduce the
demand for the limited SYSTEM Arena that can fill up with large AGP
Graphics Cards.

The Absolute Maximum File Cache Size is the largest File Cache Size that can
be allocated under any circumstances. The Maximum File Cache Size can still
be lowered, in Normal Mode only, by adding the MaxFileCache option to the
SYSTEM.INI File.

The Default MAXCACHE is 512MB. Settings above 750MB are likely to cause
problems, especially with 16-Bit Programs. Settings below 128MB may conflict
with Minimum File Cache Requirements, especially in Computers with a lot of
RAM. If setting MAXCACHE to 512MB, the MAXCACHE option is not needed.
To set the Absolute Max File Cache to 256 MB use /C:256.

The Install Only Option (/I) will only allow the Patch to be Installed. If the
Patch is already present, the Program will exit immediately.

The Move VXD Option (/M) will add code to the VMM32.VXD file to place the VXD
files within it into RAM Memory above 16MB. This frees up memory below 16MB
which may be needed for other purposes. See "FIRST 16MB OF RAM MEMORY
REQUIREMENTS" above.

The PROTHOOK Option (/P) adds code for the PROTHOOK method used by HIMEMEX.
This elimiantes the need to Install the PROTHOOK VXD when using HIMEMEX.
HIMEMEX is used by the NON-XMS RAMDISKs.



NEW WINDOWS INSTALLATIONS

If you are doing a clean install of Windows into a Computer having more than
512MB of RAM, you will need to Install the Patch before Windows runs.

If you can reduce the amount of RAM to 512MB or less, you can install
Windows normally, run the PATCHM Patch Program, then restore the additional
RAM.

If you need to Install Windows in a system with more than 512MB of RAM
present, you can do so as follows:

 1. Place the Patch Program on a DOS Floppy Disk or on a Formatted Partition.
 2. Perform the Windows installation until the FIRST reboot.
    Do not leave the Computer unattended in case Windows reboots without
    prompting.
 3. Reboot and holds the CTRL key to get the Windows Startup Menu.
    NOTE: If Windows starts without the Startup Menu, it may crash. If so,
          press RESET and wait for the Windows Startup Menu. You may need
          to turn Power back on if it shut off.
 4. Select the "Command prompt only" option and press ENTER.
 5. Run the WININIT Command.
 6. Go to the Floppy Disk or Partition where the PATCHM Program is located.
 7. Run the PATCHM Program.
 8. Remove the Floppy Disk if present.
 9. Press the Reset Button or CTRL-ALT-DEL.
10. Continue the Windows Installation.

NOTE: The Demo Version of this Patch freezes after 10 Minutes, so you
      probably will not be able to complete the Windows Installation. You
      will need to purchase a Full Copy of this Patch to continue Windows
      Installation.



MULTIPLE BOOT WITH OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS

The Patch is compatable with multiple boot systems. Each separate Windows
98/98SE/ME System must be Patched individually.
