                         ENCRYPTED DISK PATCH

                          Version 1.1 (DEMO)

The Encrypted Disk Patch Software patches the BIOS and Windows 98/98SE/ME to
provide full Disk Encryption. All files on the Hard Drive(s) are Encrypted
as they are written and Decrypted as they are read so no unencrypted data is
ever placed on the Hard Drive(s). If all of the Hard Drive(s) are Encrypted,
all Temporary Files, Cache Files, History Files, Swap Files, Slack Space,
etc. are Encrypted as well as all Application Files leaving no opportunity
for anyone to recover sensitive data. Laptops with all Hard Drives Encrypted
would no longer be a security threat, as no data or programs could be
recovered from them, if they were stolen.



REQUIREMENTS

Windows 95 Release 2 (See Note Below)
Windows 98, 98SE or ME.
Motherboard IDE Controller recognized by the Default ESDI_506.PDR Port Driver

For Hard Drives larger than 137GB:
High Capacity Disk Patch from Rudolph R. Loew
BIOS support for hard drives >137GB (48-Bit LBA) or
Large Hard Drive Version of the Encrypted Disk Boot Manager

NOTE: Some documentation and utilities may report this limit as 128GB.

WARNING: Some BIOSes have defective support for 48-Bit LBA. Rearranging
         Drives may cause a previously working system to fail. Verify
         support using 48BITLBA.EXE for all Drive arrangements you plan to
         use. In particular, VIA EPIA BIOSes before 07/05 may claim to
         support 48-Bit LBA, and will show the full size of the Drive, but
         will not actually support the Drive if it is not the Primary Master.
         Users of VIA EPIA motherboards should contact the Author to obtain
         a Patched BIOS if needed.

NOTE: Windows 95 performance has not been tested. If you are using the
      original version, upgrade the existing Disk Driver with REMIDEUP.EXE
      available from Microsoft at:
      http://support.microsoft.com/kb/171353/EN-US/
      before Installing the Patch.
