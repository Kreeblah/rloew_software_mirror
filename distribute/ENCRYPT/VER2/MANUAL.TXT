The Encrypted Disk Patch Software patches the BIOS and Windows 98/98SE/ME to
provide full Disk Encryption. All files on the Hard Drive(s) are Encrypted
as they are written and Decrypted as they are read, so no unencrypted data is
ever placed on the Hard Drive(s). If all of the Hard Drive(s) are Encrypted,
all Temporary Files, Cache Files, History Files, Swap Files, Slack Space,
etc. are Encrypted, as well as all Application Files, leaving no opportunity
for anyone to recover sensitive data. Laptops with all Hard Drives Encrypted
would no longer be a security threat, as no data or programs could be
recovered from them, if they were stolen.

This patch updates the standard IDE controller (ESDI_506.PDR in the Windows
SYSTEM\IOSUBSYS Directory). If you are using a controller card such as the
Promise Card included with some Maxtor or Western Digital drives, this Patch
will not affect drives connected to the Card(s). If you have installed the
Intel Application Accelerator, this driver may no longer be used and will
not work. SATA drives are not supported. A matching Boot Manager intercepts
the BIOS Disk Access Calls and provides Encryption/Decryption in DOS Mode.
The Boot Manager obtains the Password(s) from the User before the Operating
System Boots up and passes the information to the Windows Driver.



DEMO VERSION

The Demo Version of this Software has only the Floppy Based Boot Manager
Setup (DFMINST.COM) and uses a fixed Password on all Encrypted Hard Drives.
The Hard Disk Based Encrypted Boot Managers are on the Full Version only.
The ability to use secure Passwords requires use of the Full Version.
If you are using the Demo Version, you will need to obtain the Full Version
of this Software for these features. See Below for Ordering Information.

If you are using the Demo Version, ignore any instructions relating to the
Hard Drive Based Encrypted Disk Managers and their Setup Programs BMINST.COM
and FLOPINST.COM and substitute the Demo Floppy Installer DFMINST.COM in
place of the Full Version FMINST.COM. All Hard Drives Encrypted with the
Demo Version will have a Password of " " regardless of the Password typed.
A blank Password will still disable Encryption/Decryption on the specified
Hard Drive.

WARNING: Encrypted drives created by the Demo version CANNOT be converted to
         a more secure Password using the Full Version. You must copy the
         files to another drive or use mirroring software to duplicate the
         drive.



REQUIREMENTS

Windows 95 Release 2 (See Windows 95 Below)
Windows 98, 98SE or ME (See WINDOWS ME Section Below if using Windows ME)
Motherboard IDE Controller recognized by the Default ESDI_506.PDR Port Driver

For Hard Drives larger than 137GB:
High Capacity Disk Patch from Rudolph R. Loew
BIOS support for hard drives >137GB (48-Bit LBA) or
Large Hard Drive Version of the Encrypted Disk Boot Manager

WARNING: Some BIOSes have defective support for 48-Bit LBA. Rearranging
         Drives may cause a previously working system to fail. Verify
         support using 48BITLBA.EXE for all Drive arrangements you plan to
         use. In particular, VIA EPIA BIOSes before 07/05 may claim to
         support 48-Bit LBA, and will show the full size of the Drive, but
         will not actually support the Drive if it is not the Primary Master.
         Users of VIA EPIA motherboards should contact the Author to obtain
         a Patched BIOS if needed.



BIOS SUPPORT VERIFICATION (for Hard Drives larger than 137GB)

The 48BITLBA program tests your Computer's support for Large Hard Drives.
You will need at least one Hard Drive larger than 137GB connected to either
of the IDE connectors on your Motherboard. This Program is available in the
HIGH CAPACITY DISK PATCH Demo Package at:

http://rloew1.no-ip.com

Run the Program from DOS, not a DOS Box, to verify BIOS, or Boot Manager,
support for Large Hard Drives. A "48-BIT Support Verified" message should be
displayed next to the Large Hard Drive's Number and Size Report. Otherwise
your BIOS may not support Large Hard Drives.

If you get a "Last 28 Bit Sector Unsupported" message, your BIOS or Boot
Manager has a bug making it incompatible with your Hard Drive.

WARNING: Some BIOSes have defective support for 48-Bit LBA. Rearranging
Drives may cause 48-Bit LBA support to fail. Verify support with all Drive
arrangements you plan to use. In particular, there are some BIOSes that only
support 48-Bit LBA on the MASTER Drive on the PRIMARY IDE Bus.



DRIVER USAGE VERIFICATION

The DISKDVR Program scans the Registry and displays the Port Driver being
used by Windows for each IDE Bus and it's associated Info (.INF) file.
This Program must be run from a Windows DOS Box.

The Port Driver used for each IDE Bus that will be used with Large Hard
Drives must be ESDI_506.PDR for the Patch to work.

This is the Windows Default Port Driver. If you have loaded other IDE
Drivers, Windows may no longer use the ESDI_506.PDR Port Driver.

If the Port driver is reported as INTELATA.MPD, the Intel Application
Accelerator is controlling that IDE Bus. The Intel Application Accelerator
must be uninstalled before using the Encrypted Disk Patch.

If the Port driver is reported as VIADSK.MPD, the IDE Bus is being controlled
by a VIA MiniPort Driver. The June 2003 version of the VIA MiniPort Driver,
the latest version as of this release, is not compatible with some Hard
Drives and cannot be easily removed. It is not compatible with the Encrypted
Disk Patch.

If any other Port Driver is reported, please contact the Author for further
information.

NOTE: Running DISKDVR +ALL will display all Hard Disk Controllers (hdc) in
      the Registry. This includes many USB Drives.
      Running DISKDVR -SCSI will display all SCSI Disk Controllers
      (SCSIAdapter) in the Registry..



PATCH INSTALLATION

If you need full security, you will have to do a clean install of Windows
into an Encrypted Hard Drive or mirror an existing Hard Drive into an
Encrypted Hard Drive. Go to the NEW WINDOWS INSTALLATION or MIRROR EXISTING
Drive section.

The following will encrypt a newly added Hard Drive in an existing System.

Windows ME users should read the WINDOWS ME Section Below before Installing.
High Capacity Disk Patch users should read the HIGH CAPACITY DISK PATCH
Section Below before Installing.

1. Download and UnZip the Programs to a known location.
   Do not UnZip the Programs to the C:\ Directory if you do not want the
   AUTOEXEC.BAT File to be replaced.
2. Open a MS-DOS Box (Windows 98 or 98SE Only) or Boot into DOS.
   WARNING Do not Install the Patch from Windows ME. Boot from DOS or Windows
   ME SAFE MODE.
3. Go to the Directory where the programs are located.
4. Run PATCHEXP to expand the Driver.
   This is not needed for the Version 2226 of the Windows 98 SE Driver.
5. Run PATCHENC to install the patch.
6. If you are using any other Boot Manager go to step 9.
7. You can install the Encrypted Boot Manager on your Hard Drive by runnimg
   the BMINST.COM Program and goting to step 10. Otherwise continue.
8. You can install the Encrypted Boot Manager on your Hard Drive from a
   bootable Floppy by runnimg the FLOPINST.COM Program to create a Bootable
   Installation Floppy. Create the Floppy Disk, and Reboot without removing
   the Floppy Disk. This can be done from Windows ME. Otherwise continue.
9. You can load the Encrypted Boot Manager from a Floppy each time you boot
   your Computer. This does not modify your Hard Drive and will work with
   other Boot Managers. Create an ENCRYPTION Floppy Disk using the FMINST.COM
   Program. Place the Floppy Disk in your A: Drive before booting your
   Computer.
10. Reboot and enter your Password(s) (see Below). Do not enter a Password
    for the first (System) Drive.
11. If you are using a Floppy Disk to run your Partitioning Software, Press
    CNTL-C when Prompted and Insert your Partitioning Software Floppy.
12. Partition all drives that are being encrypted.
13. Reinsert the ENCRYPTION Floppy if you are using one.
14. Reboot and enter your Password(s) (see Below).
15. Format all partitions on drives that are being encrypted.



NEW WINDOWS INSTALLATIONS

If you want to have full security, the Windows System Drive must be
Encrypted. This requires that you do a clean install of Windows onto an
Encrypted Hard Drive. You will also have to Patch the Windows Driver after it
has been placed on the Hard Drive and Before it is used by Windows.

 1. Place the Patch Programs on a Bootable DOS Floppy Disk with a CD Driver
    and Partitioning and Formatting Utilities.
 2. Prepare a Boot Manager Floppy using the FMINST Program.
 3. Boot from the Boot Manager Floppy.
 4. Enter Passwords for Drives to be Encrypted.
 5. Press CTRL-C to Boot from a Floppy.
 6. Insert the Bootable DOS Floppy from step 1.
 7. Partition the Encrypted Hard Drives and any others needing Partitioning.
 8. Repeat Steps 3 thru 6.
10. Format all new Partitions.
11. Insert the Windows Installation CD.
12. Perform the Windows installation until the FIRST reboot.
    Do not leave the Computer unattended in case Windows reboots without
    prompting.
13. Repeat Steps 3 thru 6.
14. Run the Patch Programs.
15. Repeat Steps 3 and 4.
16. Continue the Windows Installation keeping the Boot Manager Floppy in the
    drive and repeat step 4 after each reboot.
    If the driver was not found in Step 14, insert the Boot Manager Floppy
    perform Steps 13 and 14 at the Second Windows Reboot. If the Program
    still cannot find the driver, you will have to look for the
    ESDI_506.PDR and use the Specific File option described above. DO NOT
    allow Windows to startup after the Second Reboot until the Patch has
    been Installed successfully.
17. You may optionally install the Encrypted Boot Manager on your Boot Hard
    Drive using the BMINST or FLOPINST Programs. Otherwise continue to use
    the Boot Manager Floppy on each Reboot.

If you have a CD Burner or you install Windows from files placed on the hard
drive, you can purchase a pre-patched Installation Cabinet File for your
version of Windows. By replacing the original Cabinet File in the Installation
CD or Folder you can install Windows without further patching. This will not
protect you if an update replaces the Patched driver or it is corrupted.

WARNING: If you install Motherboard Drivers provided by the manufacturer of
the Motherboard, you may disable the Patched Driver. You may also have the
option to skip installation of these Drivers. Run the DISKDVR.EXE Program
after installing the Drivers but BEFORE you reboot the Computer. You may
have to choose the "Reboot Later" option if asked to Reboot to run the
Program. If the DISKDVR.EXE Program reports that a Port Driver other than
ESDI_506.PDR is now selected, you will have to uninstall it before rebooting.
If you can't uninstall it, you will have to start the Windows Installation
from scratch.



MIRRORING EXISTING DRIVES

To Encrypt, Decrypt or change the Password on an existing Drive, you will
need to mirror the entire Drive to another Hard Drive of at least the same
size. You have the option of mirroring back to the First Hard Drive if the
Second Hard Drive is larger or is on loan.

1. Prepare a Boot Manager Floppy using the FMINST Program.
2. Place both Hard Drives in a single Computer connected to either of the IDE
   connectors on the Motherboard.
3. Insert the Boot Manager Floppy in the A: Drive and Boot your Computer.
4. Enter the Passwords for each Drive.
   On the Source Drive, enter it's Password if already Encrypted, else none.     
   On the Destination Drive, enter it's Password if Encryption is desired,
   else none.
   On all other drive, enter their Passwords (if any) or none.
5. If your Mirroring Program is NOT on a Floppy skip to Step 10.
6. Press CTRL-C when Prompted.
7. Insert your Bootable DOS Disk with your Partitioning Tools.
8. Mirror your Drives.
9. Shutdown and Remove Drive(s) from System, you are done.
10. If you are mirroring your Boot Drive and are running Windows, terminate
    as many tasks as possible.
    NOTE: The mirror will be flagged as improperly Shutdown if you boot from
          it . This should not be a problem if no other activity is changing
          your Boot Drive during the Mirroring operation.
11. Use your Mirroring Software to Mirror your Drive.
12. Shutdown and Remove Drive(s) from System, you are done.



USING THE ENCRYPTED DISK SOFTWARE

If you are using the Floppy Based Encrypted Boot Manager (created by FMINST),
place the Floppy in the A: Drive before Booting your Computer.

The Encrypted Boot Manager takes control during Boot.
It will ask for Passwords for each IDE Hard Drive that it finds.
Enter a Password of up to 16 Characters for each drive you wish to Encrypt.
A blank Password will disable Encryption for that Drive.
You will then be prompted to press CTRL-C if you wish to Boot from a Floppy.
You can Press CTRL-C and insert a Bootable Floppy, or wait 5 Seconds for
 the Hard Drive to Boot.
The Passwords are automatically passed to Windows.
Passwords should be at least 9 characters and the last character should be
 different from the first character. A Password consisting of Space Characters
 is not considered blank.

WARNING: Passwords CANNOT be added, deleted, or changed without replacing
         all data on the affected Hard Drive(s).

NOTE: If the Encrypted Disk Driver is not Installed or fails to Install,
      Windows may go into Compatibility Mode and allow access to the Encrypted
      Hard Drive using the Encrypted Boot Manager at reduced performance.
      To verify that the Encrypted Disk Patch is working properly, open the
      Device Manager and verify that the Hard Disk Controllers do not have a
      Yellow Exclamation Mark next to them. In Compatibility mode, performance
      will be reduced and any CD/DVD drive on the same IDE bus will be
      unavailable.



AUTOMATIC PATCH INSTALLATION/VERIFICATION (Windows 98 and 98SE Only)

The Program can be setup to automatically verify and repatch, if necessary,
each time the computer is booted. This will prevent corruption if the Patch
is overwritten by other software.

If an unrecognized or corrupt driver is found, the Program will prevent
Bootup from progressing to prevent possible corruption.

IMPORTANT: Do not use this method with Windows ME.

To Setup Automatic Patch Installation/Verification perform the following
steps:

1. Download and UnZip the Program to a known location.
2. Copy the PATCHEXP.EXE to C:\PATCHEXP.EXE
3. Copy the PATCHENC.EXE to C:\PATCHENC.EXE
4. If there is no C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT file or it is empty, copy the supplied
   UnZipped AUTOEXEC.BAT to C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT.
5. If you already have a C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT file, add the following line to it:

   C:\PATCHEXP.EXE -V
   C:\PATCHENC.EXE -V

   Do not use LOADHIGH or LH with this program, it is not needed.


If you wish to put the Programs in a different Folder perform the following
step:.

Add the following line to your C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

X:\PATH\PATCHEXP.EXE -V
X:\PATH\PATCHENC.EXE -V

Where X:\PATH is the Drive and Folder where the Program is located.


WARNING: If the Patch Program ever interrupts the Boot Sequence and reports
an error. It is STRONGLY recommended that you do NOT press ENTER to Continue
if you have any Encrypted Drives. You should Press RESET to Reboot the
Computer and either use a Boot Floppy or the "Command Prompt Only" from the
Windows Startup Menu until the problem is resolved.



WINDOWS 95

Author has not tested Windows 95 Support and Microsoft claims that Windows
95 does not support more than 32GB. Use this Patch with Windows 95 at your
own risk.

It is strongly recommended that you update your Disk Driver up to Version
4.00.1116 or later before installing the Patch. The upgrade to Version
4.00.1116 is available from Microsoft at

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/171353/EN-US/



WINDOWS ME

Windows ME contains a number of changes that affect the Installation and
Verification of the Encrypted Disk Patch.

Windows ME does not use the AUTOEXEC.BAT file during boot so Automatic
Installation and Verification cannot be performed. Commands placed in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file will be ignored.

Microsoft added a function called "System File Protection" (SFP) that
prevents changes to System files including the ESDI_506.PDR file Patched by
the Encrypted Disk Patch. This function cannot be disabled.

If any file protected by SFP is changed, SFP will replace it with the old
version a few seconds later without any warning or indication.

The Patch can only be Installed from DOS, not a DOS Box, or from SAFE MODE
where SFP is not active.

The Patch can be Uninstalled in Windows but a Reinstallation will be lost.

To stop SFP from protecting the ESDI_506.PDR file, perform the following
steps:

1. Boot from DOS
2. Edit the FILELIST.XML file in the Windows SYSTEM\RESTORE folder.
3. Remove the lines referring to the FILELIST.XML and ESDI_506.PDR files.
4. Save the updated file.

Windows ME has a new feature called "System Restore" which allows changes to
be rolled back. If you use System Restore to rollback before the Patch was
installed, you will lose the Patch and risk losing access.



UNINSTALL PATCH (See WARNING Section Below)

1. Download and UnZip the Program to a known location (if necessary).
2. Open a MS-DOS Box or Boot into DOS.
3. Go to the Directory where the program is located.
4. Run PATCHENC.
5. Type Yes to the Uninstall request to uninstall the patch.
6. Run PATCHEXP.
7. Type Yes to the Uninstall request to uninstall the expansion.
8. Remove the C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT file or the line in it that invokes the
   PATCHEXP and PATCHENC Programs if you are using the Automatic
   Installation/Verification Mode of the Software.
9. If you have installed the Encrypted Boot Manager on your Hard Drive (using
   BMINST or FLOPINST) run UNINST to remove the Boot Manager. If you are
   using the Floppy Disk created by FMINST or DFMINST you do not need to
   uninstall the Boot Manager. Removing the Floppy Disk from your A: drive
   will stop it from running. The Floppy can be reformatted if no longer
   needed.
10. Repartition and reformat any Hard Drives that were previously Encrypted.



OTHER PROGRAMS, PATCHES, DRIVERS AND UPDATES

There are a number of other programs which can disable this Patch if they are
installed. Some overwrite the ESDI_506.PDR Port Driver, while others reassign
the IDE driver in the Registry bypassing the ESDI_506.PDR Port Driver.

The following is a list of known programs that will disable this Patch. There
are probably others. Any program that promises to improve Hard Disk
performance, except defraggers, or provide monitoring of Hard Disk operations,
is suspect.

Microsoft Fix Q243450.

    This Fix updates the ESDI_506.PDR in Windows 98 or 98SE to fix a
    problem with some Phoenix BIOSes. The Encrypted Disk Patch can Patch
    this Fix.

    1. Run the Microsoft Patch but do NOT reboot.
    2. Reinstall the Encrypted Disk Patch.
    3. Reboot

Intel Application Accelerator.

    The Intel Application Accelerator provides Large Hard Drive Support and
    other features for certain Intel Chipsets. This program will bypass the
    ESDI_506.PDR Port Driver and use one called INTELATA.MPD instead. This
    program is not compatible with the Encrypted Disk Patch and must be
    Uninstalled.

VIA IDE Miniport Driver.

    The VIA IDE Miniport Driver provides Large Hard Drive Support and
    other features for certain VIA Chipsets. This program will bypass the
    ESDI_506.PDR Port Driver and use one called VIADSK.MPD instead.
    Version 3.20B is the most recent version to date (08/03).
    The Driver has a flaw that can cause errors to appear on Large Seagate
    Drives and possibly others. This program is very difficult to uninstall,
    and is not compatible with the Encrypted Disk Patch.

Unfortunately there is no way to determine what effect other programs will
have until they are installed. Some installations cannot be undone. If the
program does not return an error to Windows, causing it to go into
Compatibility Mode, and this Patch cannot be reapplied, you will not be able
to access your data.

Doing a complete backup of your system is STRONGLY recommended before
installing any such program.



WARNING

IF THE PASSWORD(S) ARE LOST ALL DATA ON THOSE ENCRYPTED HARD DRIVES WILL BE
INACCESSIBLE UNTIL THE PASSWORD IS FOUND. NO WORKAROUND OR RECOVERY OPTION IS
AVAILABLE FROM AUTHOR.

THE POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR DATA LOSS TO OCCUR DUE TO ERRORS IN THE PATCH OR
IF THE PATCHED DRIVER IS BYPASSED OR OVERWRITTEN. DO NOT USE IN CRITICAL
SYSTEMS OR WHERE HUMAN SAFETY IS INVOLVED.

Please E-Mail any Bug Reports to RLoew@hotmail.com.

If you install a Windows update that replaces the ESDI_506.PDR file or
uninstalls the Patch, you may be unable to access the encrypted files.
If your system files are encrypted, you will not be able to boot Windows
normally. You will have to boot in Safe Mode or into DOS to repatch the
driver. If in doubt, rerun the PATCHEXP and PATCHENC Programs BEFORE allowing
Windows to Reboot and Answer NO to the Uninstall Request if it appears. If
the Computer Reboots before you can run the Program, make it boot in Safe
Mode, apply the Patch and Reboot again. See the AUTOMATIC PATCH
INSTALLATION/VERIFICATION Section above for instructions to setup Windows to
have the Patch Verified and Reinstalled (if necessary) on each boot.

Usage without the Encrypted Disk Manager will disasble all Encryption and
Decryption. Encrypted files will not be accessible. Windows may crash if
data drives are Encrypted. Windows will not boot if the Drive it is on is
encrypted

Installing this Patch on Windows NT, 2000, or XP has not been tested and may
corrupt your Hard Drive.



OPTIONS

The Programs automatically examine the Computer to locate the Driver File.

The Programs can be redirected to Patch a specific File by specifying a
FileName as follows:

PATCHEXP MYDRIVER.PDR
PATCHENC MYDRIVER.PDR

The Drive File is renamed to provide a Backup File before the Patched Driver
File is written. The Backup File has the same name as the Driver File but the
extension is changed to .ba_ (PATCHEXP) and .bac (PATCHENC) provided the
FileName has an extension. If not, .ba_ and .bac extensions are added.

If an earlier Version of the Patch is found, or a Demo Version, it is
replaced with the new Version. The Backup File is used to create the new
Patch so it must be present.

The Patched Driver File is deleted and the Backup File is renamed back if the
Patch is Uninstalled. If the Backup File is not present, the Patch cannot be
Uninstalled.

The two Patch Programs should be run in the following order:
See the HIGH CAPACITYT DISK PATCH Section Below if using PATCHATA.

Installation:    PATCHEXP then PATCHENC
UnInstallation:  PATCHENC then PATCHEXP

The INSTALL/VERIFY mode is specified by adding "-V" (ex. PATCHENC -V).

   The Program will verify if the Patch is present or not.
   If present, the Program will print a report and exit.
   If not, the Program will attempt to Install the Patch.
   If successful, the Program will print a report and exit.
   If not, the Program will print a failure report and wait until you press
   ENTER or you REBOOT the Computer (Strongly recommened).



MULTIPLE BOOT WITH OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS

The Floppy based Boot Manager Loader (created by FMINST) is compatible with
multiple boot systems consisting of DOS and/or Windows 98/SE/ME systems.
Each separate Windows 98/98SE/ME System must be Patched individually.
All other Operating Systems must be placed on unencrypted Drives and not
recognize any partiitons on the Encrypted Drives.



BOOTMAN

BOOTMAN is a Mini Boot Manager designed to provide Large Hard Drive support
for BIOSes that only support 137GB. It is not compatible with the Encrypted
Disk Patch. An Encrypted Disk Patch Boot Manager with Large Hard Drive
support is available at no extra charge for existing BOOTMAN customers.
Uninstall BOOTMAN before installing the ENCRYPTED BOOT MANAGER.



HIGH CAPACITY DISK PATCH

The HIGH CAPACITY DISK PATCH provides Large Hard Drive support for Windows
98/SE/ME. It is compatible with the Encrypted Disk Patch. This Patch is
required to use Hard Drives Larger than 137GB with Windows 98, SE or ME.
You may also need BIOS support for large Hard Drives, see BOOTMAN above.
New Customers, Please contact Rudolph R. Loew (See Below) for more
information on this Product.

If you are using the HIGH CAPACITY DISK PATCH with the ENCRYPTED DISK PATCH,
you will need to combine the installations.

Read the MANUAL.TXT files for both Packages before proceeding.

Use the installation instructions above but add the PATCHATA Program to the
DOS Floppy and run the PATCHATA Program immediately before running the
PATCHEXP and PATCHENC Programs wherever they are used.

Uninstall in the following order:

PATCHENC
PATCHEXP
PATCHATA

Uninstalling in any other order may remove more than one Patch at a time
and will leave unneeded backup files.


If using the AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION/VERIFY feature, you will need to combine
the data in the two supplied AUTOEXEC.BAT files or add the following to an
existing AUTOEXEC.BAT:

C:\PATCHATA -V
C:\PATCHEXP -V
C:\PATCHENC -V

You will also need to copy all three Programs to your C:\ folder.
